<h3>Background and History</h3>
    <p>Archaeologists and people with a general interest in history  have always believed that Ribe played an important role in the  Denmark of the Viking Age. The challenge, of course, was to put  this claim to the test of scientific examination. Excavations  carried out in the area by Den Antikvariske Samling (The  Antiquarian Collection, now part of Sydvestjyske Museer, the  association of museums in south-western Denmark) over the last many  years have fully confirmed these assumptions. Almost every year,  new and exciting finds are made, and there is no longer any doubt  that Ribe is one the world's most important regions for the  documentation of trade, craftsmanship and farming in the Viking  Age. For instance, new knowledge has been published, based on finds  made in Ribe, proving that thrown ceramics were manufactured in  Denmark 500 years earlier than previously believed. The discovery  of hop remains should perhaps also lead us to change our perception  of the time at which the Danes began to brew beer.</p>
    <p>As a natural consequence of our strong roots in the past, Ribe  VikingeCenter was established in 1992. At the present time we have  built up three different Viking environments of great importance  and impeccable craftsmanship: The Market Place and adjoining ship,  an authentic copy of a site from the early 8th century. The Great  Farm from 980 AD; a long-house with 5 connected buildings. Eight  town-houses from the year 825 AD. It is thus possible to experience  the developments that took place over the course of the Viking Age  and in this way gain insights into an important epoch in Danish  history, which is seen by most Danes as crucial to the formation of  our culture.</p>
    <img src="jquery-mobile/images/__Interiør_3.jpeg" width="280" height="130" alt="b">
<p>All of our reconstructions have been created in close  collaboration with Den Antikvariske Samling, which has carried out  the excavations on which our reconstructions are based and placed  their expertise at the disposal of our architects and our  craftsmen.</p>
    <h3>Presentation and Communication</h3>
    <p>The stated purpose of Ribe VikingeCenter is to communicate  Ribe's Viking Age history by bringing it to life in our  reconstructed environments. Alongside the presentation, theories  are tested and developed through experimental archaeology; not just  as regards the reconstruction of buildings, garments, tools and  equipment but also in relation to the sociological side of history:  How did communal life take shape under the physical conditions and  surroundings of the past.</p>
    <p>Our theoretical foundation is built on the way historical  workshops traditionally present historical information:  Presentations reflect a high level of academic commitment, they are  in-depth, taking place over extended periods and in authentic  surroundings. As another important aspect we have chosen to let the  creation and maintenance of our reconstructions form part of the  presentation itself. This is naturally time-consuming but provides  us with a dynamism that cannot be achieved by simply opening up a  "finished" centre.</p>
    <p>At Ribe VikingeCenter, visitors can always experience new  projects in the making, which naturally piques the curiosity. One  wishes to learn more about the newly emerging features and this  becomes an opportunity for interaction with the craftsmen. Many  return again and again to see the final results of the works they  have witnessed in progress. The conservation of old crafts and  trades is a very important issue, in this context. The living  environments offer an opportunity to see many traditional crafts  carried out and for experiences to be exchanged, which would  otherwise be at risk of getting lost over time. Remarks such as,  "My grandfather did this in the same way" and "Were the Vikings  really this sophisticated?" or "Wouldn't it be possible to…," etc.  are commonplace at the Centre and helps make interactions engaging  and interesting for both visitors and staff.</p>
    <h3>Staff</h3>
    <p>Ribe VikingeCenter is a multi-facetted and exciting business,  also when it comes to our staff.</p>
    <p>We cooperate closely with Produktionsskolen Lustrupholm , which  means that we have approx. 30 students of 16-25 years connected to  the Centre, all year round. Production school students are an  integral and important part of our historical reconstructions and  communication. Students participate in, among other things, the  manufacture of Viking garments and the maintenance and production  of equipment for our houses. They take good care of our many  animals and participate in the daily operation of our kitchen and  café. In the summer, students and staff play a pivotal role in  bringing history to life at Ribe VikingeCenter, working side by  side with volunteer artisans from all across Europe.</p>
    <img src="jquery-mobile/images/__Markedsplads_3.jpeg" width="280" height="130" alt="c">
<p>Ribe VikingeCenter has a highly competent staff who over the  years have amassed an enormous wealth of expertise in historical  craftsmanship, reconstruction work and communication. The staff of  the Viking Centre and Production School numbers around 20 in the  winter part of the year and approximately 30 in the Summer season.  A number of our colleagues are employed on flexitime contracts and  we cooperate with Esbjerg Kommune in testing the work-abilities of  people with regards to the clarification of their role in the  flexitime system.</p>
    <h3>Volunteers</h3>
    <p>The Centre keeps contact with many different volunteer groups.  These are committed adults and children with an interest in and  knowledge of crafts and techniques employed in the Viking Age. Some  have organized themselves in specific interest groups, such as  smiths, archers and horsemen - others are affiliated as individuals  through whichever craft they have mastered. Volunteers take part in  our presentation on certain occasions, coinciding with their free  time, etc. Many have learned their craft by working with some of  the best craftsmen in Denmark and their skills and historical  knowledge are constantly updated, in order to communicate  historical knowledge as accurately and authentically as  possible.</p>
    <p>In addition to Viking groups and individuals with connections to  Ribe VikingeCenter we are visited each year by around 300 Vikings  from all over the world, but especially from Denmark, Germany and  Holland - people who spend large amounts of their free time  studying, reconstructing and living the Viking "way of life." They  are active and positive contributors to the Centre's efforts to  make the past come alive, just as we, through the foreign guest  Vikings, are given insight into the garment and equipment of the  period from northern Norway to Miklagård/Byzans.</p>
<h3>Academic and Specialist Partners</h3>
    <p>Ribe VikingeCenter cooperates with a large number of specialists  and institutions on both theory and its application. This can be in  regards to concrete issues, but cooperation often takes the form of  a dialogue where we attempt to apply our ideas, gained through  everyday experimentation, to the theoretical framework offered by  academic research, with the goal of reaching a wider understanding  of the past. Many of our contacts work in state-approved museums or  have been recognized for their abilities or craft to such an extent  that their knowledge and expertise can be safely employed in a  museum context.</p>
    <h3>Den Antikvariske Samling/Sydvestjyske Museer</h3>
    <p>One of our fundamental partners is Sydvestjyske Museer (formerly  "Den Antikvariske Samling"). Since Ribe VikingeCenter's  inauguration in 1992, a close partnership has been maintained  between the two institutions. As such, the reconstruction of our  three Viking environments from Ribe has been carried out in  accordance with excavations done by the museum and under  professional supervision from their archaeologists, just as they  continue to contribute their historical knowledge of both specific  issues and problems of a more general nature. In return, the Viking  Centre can contribute our practical, experimental experience,  regarding for instance the use of tools and household items,  wear-and-tear on shoes and more. Furthermore, we have produced  several reconstructions for use in the exhibition at the museum  Ribes Vikinger: a plank road, costumes and a number of forged  objects.</p>
    <img src="jquery-mobile/images/_maler_hvid.jpeg" width="180" height="305" alt="d">
<h3>New Projects</h3>
    <p>Ribe VikingeCenter is constantly planning new projects and  activities. Parallel to the reconstruction work done in the three  Viking environments, we have built a new and incredibly handsome  area of entry, a historical playground, the Viking ship Gisla has  been built in collaboration with the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde  and we have created a kayaking station and a new archery range. The  Centre continues to expand the number of visitor activities and we  have produced historically accurate Viking clothes in a children's  size, in order to give our youngest visitors the best possible way  to imagine themselves as parts of history. Furthermore, together  with the school service in Esbjerg Kommune, we have established a  school program for 5th and 6th graders.</p>
    <p>Ribe VikingeCenter are at the forefront of both reconstruction  and communication and we are constantly developing our working  processes - this is for us the best way to remain an interesting  and engaging site to visit… again and again!</p>

    <h2>The Beginning of Ribe</h2>
      <h3>A Bustling Market</h3>
<div><img src="jquery-mobile/images/__Markedsplads_4.jpeg" width="300" height="150" alt="i"></div>
      <p><em>The area which will one day be known as Ribe is buzzing with  life. Artisans and merchants from all over the Denmark of the time  and as far away as Gothland, England, the kingdom of the Franks,  Spain and Byzantium congregate there. The traders rent a small  parcel of land from one of the king's officials. Here, they can  sell their wares, and maybe even display them. In return, they are  guaranteed the king's protection, as no one is allowed to steal,  rob or assault anyone in the area.</em></p>
      <p><em>The whole square is full of the condensed atmosphere of  life. The loud peal of hammering mingles with the cries of the  fishwives, bakers and entertainers. It smells of dripping, honey,  and exotic spices - as well as of cow-dung, urine and offal. The  boy tightens his grip on the leather pouch full of the lumps of  amber he has collected during the winter - then he ducks into the  roaring crowd of market-goers, craftsmen and merchants.</em></p>

<h3>Reconstructions at Ribe VikingeCenter</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <div> </div>
        <p>Visit Denmark's most authentic Viking  market at Ribe VikingeCenter. It takes place every year during the  first week of May.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The street running alongside Ribe Å, which is today known as  Sct. Nicolajgade, was from approx. 705 to 850 AD the main street of  a market place, 65 meters across and more than 200 meters long. The  partly plank covered road was bordered by 70 - 80 fenced parcels  where artisans and traders had erected their stands, presumably  against some form of tribute paid to the local authorities.</p>
      <p>As such, the site reconstructed at Ribe VikingeCenter is approx.  one fifth of the original market's size. No traces of permanent  settlement have been found from the early period of the market  place, so we are led to suppose that it was only in use for parts  of the year. Traders would most likely have spent the nights aboard  their ships, in smaller temporary shacks or in tents.</p>
      <h3>Craftmanship, trade and silver coins</h3>
      <div></div>
      <p>Archeologists have recovered debris from shops working with textiles, leather,antler, bone, glass, amber, bronze casting and more. In addition, a rather large number of imported goods have  been found on the market place: Shards of drinking glasses,  grinding stones, quern stones, whale bone, rock crystal, jewelry and ceramics. Recovered dung shows that there was some trade in cattle and we  should also imagine a lively trade in easily-perishable products  such as wood and bark objects, furs, bread, flour, fish, salt and  the like.</p>
      <p>Services and goods were presumably traded directly to a large  extent but payment could also be made in the form of silver coins, sceattas. From  the time they appear, around 720 AD, and until they go out of use,  approximately 80 years later, more than 150 of these coins have  been found, scattered across the market place. In the surrounding  villages, this type of coin has only been found in a single  location, something that suggests that they have been closely  linked with the commerce on the market place in Ribe.</p>

    <h1>Ribe Town, 825 AD</h1>

  <div data-role="content" data-theme="a">
    <div>
      <h2>Town Life in Viking Age Ribe</h2>
    </div>
    <h3>Come Meet The Inhabitants</h3>
    <img src="jquery-mobile/images/__Kvinder_1.jpeg" width="300" height="200" alt="k">
<p>In the town environment from 825 AD you can visit the innkeeper  family who bake fresh flatbread every day - and when guests are  staying over, they usually have a large pot simmering on the  fire.</p>
    <p>The lady of the Thing House keep a watchful eye on her many  children who take care of different tasks in the household. The  town is also home to a shoemaker, silver smith and carpenter, but  you can never tell who will be at home on any given summer day, for  the men are easily tempted by dreams of adventure and swift riches  and go away for long periods with the town chieftain, Angantyr. The  Viking women are used to handling everything by themselves - they  are most definitely the "foremothers" of todays strong and  independent Scandinavian women.</p>
    <div></div>
    <h3>Professional craftsmen</h3>
    <p>"Ribe" as a place name is first found in the Life of Ansgar, put  in writing around 870 AD, but we know that the settlement of the  area at this time had been around for more than 150 years.</p>
    <p>Around the year 800 there was a denser settlement north of the  river, in connection with the market place, which had been used  seasonally for 100 years.</p>
    <img src="jquery-mobile/images/__Interiør_1.jpeg" width="280" height="130" alt="l">
<p>In the Ribe of the Viking Age you find - in contrast to the  self-sufficient farming communities of the Iron Age - professional  artisans who are able to subsist to a large extent on the value of  their crafts alone.</p>
    <p>To the west, Ribe was bordered naturally by the small river and  in the first half of the 9th century a two-meter wide ditch and low  wall was built in a half circle to the east. This would have been a  symbolic demarcation, showing that within the walls, the laws,  rights and obligations of the town community were enforced. At this  time there would have been no real military significance in the  building of the wall, however in the middle of the 12th century it  appears that a fortification of Ribe becomes necessary and the  ditch is expanded to form a proper moat.</p>
    <p>North of Ribe Å, the present day town is located in the same  spot as it was in the Viking Age. New fragments of history appear  every time the modern town digs into the ground to make room for  basements, piping, etc., but archeological excavations are made  more difficult by the surrounding buildings. As you walk through  the reconstruction of Ribe Town, 825 AD, at Ribe VikingeCenter, you  can form your own impression of how the inn, the Ribe house  (silversmith), cobbler's house, and the streets themselves would  have appeared.</p>
    <h3>Get involved</h3>
    <p>Hands-on  activities are never short, and in Ribe town, 825 AD you can  try some of the amusing Viking games. Borrow a Viking cape and  become a member of the Viking family, bake your own flatbread  etc. Check out the What's on event calendar for special  events.

    <h1>The Manor Farm, 980 AD</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content" data-theme="a">
    <div>
      <h2>Man and Animal on the Farm</h2>
    </div>
    <h3>An Imposing Estate</h3>
    <img src="jquery-mobile/images/__harver_hj_2.jpeg" width="300" height="200" alt="m">
<p><em>Two hour's brisk walk to the south-west of Ribe, right out  where the fields smell of seaweed and the salty wind from the sea  scratches girls' cheeks like rough, bristly kisses, in 980 AD there  is an imposing Viking manor. Besides the longhouse, there are  stalls and a smithy, barns, workshops and pit-houses on the more  than 20,000 m² of land staked out by plaited willow hedges and neat  wooden fences.</em></p>
    <p>This estate was excavated during the period between 1986 and  1994 in Gammel Hviding, and it was later reconstructed at Ribe  VikingeCenter. On the site there are traces of buildings from about  400 BC to approximately 1150 AD, and it is often hard to work out  which buildings existed at the same time. Ribe VikingeCenter's  reconstruction is, however, the best estimate archaeologists can  offer for the time being.</p>  
<h3>They daily chores </h3>
    <p>Life at the manor was hard for some and more comfortable for  others. Meet the Vikings on the farm. They are busy with the daily  chores involved in managing the large household. The animals  need looking after, and there's work to be done in the field and in  the herb garden. Chopping wood, cooking, spinning and weaving are  just some of the tasks that need to be done. </p>
    <p>Inside by the fireplace, you can breathe in the atmosphere and  the typical smells flowing through the fairly dark hall: sausages  by the fireplace, dried herbs, damp woollen blankets, perhaps  some old seaweed in a trap hanging on the wall, not to mention  smoke!</p>
    <p>Step inside the magnificent longhouse and sit down for a while.  As your eyes become used to the dark, surprising details will  appear. In the company of the Vikings, you can let your imagination  take you back to the world of 1000 years ago.</p>
    <img src="jquery-mobile/images/__katte_1.jpeg" width="280" height="130" alt="n">
<h3>The animals on the farm</h3>
    <p>Around the farm you will encounter a number of the animals  that were of importance to farm life in the Viking Age. The cattle  provides the family with milk and butter, as well as meat,  leather, drinking horns, bones for spoons etc. The milk of the  sheep can also be used and the Vikings are happy to eat their meat,  but the most important thing is their wool, which is used in  fabrication of cloth. Bullocks are used as draught animals in the  fields, whereas horses are primarily kept for riding. Geese are  noisy and sometimes 'nippy', but the Vikings are still fond of them  as they provide down for pillows and guiding feathers for the  hunter's arrows. The hens walk around freely and uncaged and their  little chicks, like the kittens, are almost impossible to  resist.</p>
    <p>Common to all animals of Ribe VikingeCenter is that their  genetic forebears reach all the way back to the Viking Age.</p>
    <img src="jquery-mobile/images/__Mark_hør_1.jpeg" width="280" height="130" alt="o">
<h3>The crop fields </h3>
    <p>The daily life of the Viking family - day in and day out, year  after year - involved providing for their everyday needs: making  sure everyone had a roof over their heads and clothes to wear,  providing warmth and food. In some seasons it was easy to find  food; but you also had to think about the future and prepare for  the long winter. People grew various types of vegetable as well as  gathering roots, nuts an berries from the wild - and everything had  to be dried, pickled, brewed or in some way preserved.</p>
    <p>In the Viking Age, good advice about working ones fields - as  well as about many other things - was passed on orally to the next  generation. The following is from the poem Havamál:</p>
    <p>Trust not an acre early sown, Nor praise a son too soon: Weather  rules the acre, wit the son. Both are exposed to peril.</p>

<h3>The Vikings Liked Their Games</h3>
    <p>There's nothing new about it,   actually. Both archealogical and written sources state that Vikings of   all ages went in for athletics and competed on different levels. The   Vikings primarily used games to practise strength, balance,   intelligence, coordination and cooperation. Skills that were   particularly important in everyday life and in battle, too. Some Vikings   took it even further and made their mark as great athletes.</p>
    <p>Archeaologists have found board   games, skates, bows and arrows, and toy weapons. The Sagas tell about   ball games, swimming, fencing, wrestling, weightlifting, and archery. Of   daily practice, warm-up, massage, and mental concentration. Sports and   athletics made an important element in the Viking culture, and big games   or contests were held in all of Scandinavia. The biggest games   apparently went on for weeks.    </p>
    <h3>Learn the Vikings' games</h3>
    <p>On your way around Ribe   VikingCenter you will come across different challenges involving   jumping, running, pulling and so on. Pillow fight, quoits and Hnefatafle   board game awaits you in Ribe Town, 825 AD. Also, every day you're   invited to join the old games, and don't be alarmed if you don't know   the rules. Viking instructors will be around to show you how it goes.   The games are simple and amusing.</p>
    <h3>VikingGames tournament</h3>
